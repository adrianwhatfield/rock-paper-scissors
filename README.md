# rock-paper-scissors
**JavaScript Basics Project - The Odin Project**

This project plays a game of rock, paper, scissors until either the player or computer reaches 5 points and resets the game when this happens.

This was made as a part of the Odin Project's Foundation course.

This project challenged me to use JavaScript as part of a full project for the first time and taught me how to manipulate the DOM and the importance of re-writing old code.
